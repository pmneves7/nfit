# Performance notes

nfit selects conservative CPU and memory strategies automatically. Most users
only need to limit grid sizes and install an optional acceleration backend for
large jobs.

## Rebinning and event reduction

Small rebinning jobs use NumPy. Large jobs can use a fused Numba kernel with
memory-bounded private accumulators. Extremely sparse output grids may use
touched-bin maps when their estimated occupancy is at most 5%; otherwise nfit
falls back to a serial fused kernel if threaded copies exceed the memory
budget.

`rebin_nd_stream` and MDEvent reduction process source data in bounded batches,
so source files may exceed RAM. Explicit output limits permit one pass;
automatic limits require a discovery pass. The batch target bounds temporary
event storage but cannot reduce the persistent output arrays.

Before a 4D MDEvent reduction, the GUI estimates peak memory from the output
bin counts and normalization arrays. It warns above 70% of available RAM. The
lower-level API rejects an over-budget allocation unless the caller explicitly
disables enforcement.

Use `benchmarks/benchmark_rebin.py` to measure representative grids on the
target machine.

## Heisenberg RPA

For $M$ fitted momentum points and $N$ magnetic sublattices, the scalar model's
batched eigendecomposition costs approximately $O(MN^3)$. nfit reduces this
cost without changing the result:

- masked data are prepared once per fit;
- datasets with zero fit weight are evaluated only after optimization;
- phase geometry and form factors are cached per dataset;
- centered cells are reduced to translationally distinct magnetic sites when
  the interaction permits it;
- exchange-independent geometry is reused between value and Jacobian calls;
- analytic scalar-model derivatives avoid one model evaluation per parameter;
- gradients stream in bounded point blocks; and
- GUI views, overlays, and analysis fingerprints use bounded caches.

Primitive-cell reduction is often the largest exact saving because the
eigendecomposition cost is cubic in $N$. See
[Heisenberg RPA](heisenberg_rpa.md#primitive-cell-reduction).

For many small matrices, a fused Numba Jacobi eigensolver removes repeated
LAPACK call overhead. Larger matrices use LAPACK, with batch-level threading
only when the workload can amortize dispatch.

## Compute backends

The resolvent contractions support:

| backend | use | installation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `numpy` | default and small jobs | included |
| `numba` | large CPU jobs | `pip install nfit[accel]` |
| `cupy` | large GPU jobs | `pip install nfit[gpu]` with a matching CuPy wheel |

`nfit.set_rpa_backend("auto")` is the default. It uses NumPy below roughly
50,000 points, then selects an installed accelerated backend when worthwhile.
Set `NFIT_RPA_BACKEND` or call `set_rpa_backend()` to override it.
`nfit.available_rpa_backends()` reports what is available. An unavailable
forced backend falls back to NumPy.

## Threads

nfit respects the CPUs available through affinity, cgroups, or a SLURM
allocation. Override the detected worker count with `NFIT_NUM_THREADS` or
`nfit.set_num_threads(n)`.

Batch-level eigendecomposition pins BLAS/LAPACK to one thread to avoid nested
oversubscription. On Apple silicon, Accelerate's shared AMX unit can make a
smaller worker count faster for large matrices; lower `NFIT_NUM_THREADS` if
benchmarking shows this behavior. Small primitive-cell models do not use the
threaded LAPACK path.

## Tensor interactions

Tensor interactions promote the scalar $N\times N$ exchange matrix to
$3N\times3N$:

- **Field off:** one Hermitian eigendecomposition is reused for every energy
  at a momentum. Cubic scaling makes the matrix work roughly 27 times the
  scalar cost at fixed $N$.
- **Field on:** the gyrotropic local response requires a batched linear solve
  at each fitted point.
- **Dipoles:** the Ewald tensor is cached densely and disables primitive-cell
  reduction. Its complex array has shape $(n_Q,N,N,3,3)$, where $n_Q$ is the
  number of distinct momentum points.
- **Gradients:** tensor mode uses central differences; scalar mode retains its
  analytic Jacobian.

The scalar path is unchanged when tensor interactions are disabled. See
[Heisenberg RPA](heisenberg_rpa.md#tensor-interactions) for the model
definitions.

## Closures

Field-free Onsager, SCR, and TAC calculations reuse one Brillouin-zone
eigendecomposition and cache exact closure results across a temperature
series. Field-on closures require numerical energy integration and batched
linear solves, so their cost scales with both Brillouin-zone and energy-grid
sizes.

Use a coarse grid for exploration, then check convergence of fitted and derived
quantities before reporting quantitative results. The closure equations and
grid controls are in [Sum rules and self-consistency](theory_notes.md).

## Current limitations

- Tensor mode uses finite-difference gradients.
- GPU execution does not include eigendecomposition or field-on tensor solves.
- Dipolar tensor mode cannot use primitive-cell reduction.

Broader directions are listed in [Planned features](planned_features.md).
